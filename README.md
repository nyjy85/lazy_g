# lazy_g

This lazy generator contains the necessary bare bones structure and dependencies to quick start your angular practice.  I am super lazy and one thing that prevents me from practicing cool but difficult angular things like directives is my resistence to downloading all my angular dependencies, creating files to write my angular code, and staring my server.  So I created this generator which does all of that for you.  Yay!
